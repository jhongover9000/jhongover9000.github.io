        <h2>humble(?) beginnings.</h2>
        <p style="font-size: 3vh;">
            Aight, so this was the first time that I tried HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. And me being me, I
            decided that it would be a great idea to try something that seemed like a reach. A horizontal-scrolling
            website. <i>Whoopee</i>.
            <br>
            <br>
            Turns out that it's actually a lot more difficult than just "make everything
            scroll this way". In any case, maybe half of my worktime was spent trying to figure out how to make it work.
            At one point, I rewrote the way that I had initially designed the horizontal aspect of the site because
            I realized it wasn't working with all of the elements within the site.
            <br>
            <br>
            As a result, the website itself is rather basic, with only a few little experimental features
            alongside the horizontal scrolling part of it. An example is the dynamically changing background... wait is that it?
            <i>Anyway</i>, it was an interesting first assignment that didn't go as well as I wanted it to, but 
            became the start of a trend of one ambitious project after another.
            Not much else to say about this. If you want the full documentation, you can find it <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1gCU_oIFEtCYb_b0R0Uexfbj5LIz46aXEX5Fu415uEGM/edit?usp=sharing">here</a>.
            <br>
            <br>
            Or keep scrolling to play with the embedded site.
        </p>
    </div>

    <!-- Embedded Site -->
    <div style="margin: 32vh auto 15vh;">
        <div style="margin: 20px auto; text-align: center;">
            Try the site live (features may be limited), or <a href="http://jhongover9000.github.io/assignment1/assignmentwebpage.html" target=”_blank”>open it in a new page</a>. If you can't scroll down, try scrolling outside the box.
