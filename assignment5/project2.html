        <p style="font-size: 3vh;">
            So. This was one of those ambitious projects. Note: don't play multiple audio files at once. The sound gets
            super distorted. Honestly, I'm not sure if it has to do with the memory of the browser. In truth, we still
            don't actually know what was (and still is) causing the issues.
            <br>
            <br>
            Why was this ambitious? Well, the audio for one, but also the concept. We wanted to play some six or seven audio
            files all at once and have visuals linked to each of those. Turns out that it doesn't work. The limit for no
            distortion seems to be <i>two</i> files. Now, if we had known this, we would have done something else to make up
            for this. But we didn't, since apparently nobody (was stupid enough to have) tried this before. Or maybe they did
            it in a way that actually <i>worked</i>.
            <br>
            <br>
            The thing is that it <i>does</i> work. It's just really a hit or miss. With the visuals, though, it's almost always
            a miss. The visuals (and audio) are played via p5.js, which may or may not be part of the problem. We simply don't know.
            This project was interesting, but very time consuming, resulting in multiple all-nighters in trying to get it to work.
            Oh, we also kinda did this in a few days' time, so that also added to the problem.
            If you want the full documentation, you can find it <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1g1m6g1_40ul2EIJJo78xnyTmJXtiyj8rrIVlVZWbZYU/edit?usp=sharing">here</a>.

            Keep scrolling down to see the site. Mind you, this embedded site doesn't work as well because the code hasn't been written
            in a way that adjusts according to screen size. I suggest you open it in a new page.

    <div style="margin: 32vh auto 15vh;">
        <div style="margin: 20px auto; text-align: center;">
            Try the site live (features <i>will</i> be limited), or <a href="http://jhongover9000.github.io/assignment3/index.html" target=”_blank”>open it in a new page</a>. If you can't scroll down, try scrolling outside the box.
