        <h2>me.</h2>
        <p style="font-size: 3vh;">
            Korea, Japan, and the United States; I've lived about a third of my life in each of these
            countries and have picked up a large range of cultural values and experiences from them.
            Maybe as a result of this, my interests are just as diverse. Creative writing, coding, 
            sports, theater, design, biology, and public speaking; these are just some of the many fields
            that I have found a place in. While this expansive net of interests and experiences may come 
            off as indecisive, my intentions have always been the same: to learn, and to enjoy learning.
            <br>
            <br>
            I'm told that I have a strange sense of humor and that something's not right with me, but I
            take that in stride because that's just who I am. I also like really minimalistic things,
            hence this website. Speaking of which...

        </p>
        <h2>this website.</h2>
        <p style="font-size: 3vh;">
            This website might not really seem like much. And it's not. It's super minimalistic and is made
            up of more or less the essentials, and that's about it. But it's a design that I like a lot. It's
            also something that holds sentimental value.
            <br>
            <br>
            You see, back when I was in high school and didn't know a single thing about coding or HTML, my
            friends and I decided that we wanted to create our own portfolio websites. Since we didn't know about
            coding, we used Google Sites (I <i>know</i>, look I knew literally <i>nothing</i> about coding then)
            to make the skeletons of our sites. But we never finished. Left incomplete, the website is somewhere
            out there in the Internet. And so I thought that this was a great opportunity to get some closure. I
            also know a lot more about coding and HTML, so I can make it how I envisioned it, too.
            <br>
            <br>
            And so that's what this website is. Me completing what I started years ago.
