        <h2>a love story.</h2>
        <p style="font-size: 3vh;">
            Despite how it might seem, I'm actually a pretty romantic guy. In any case, the idea for this project started
            with the idea of a letter from one's self. And then, I dunno, it just kinda.. happened. I've always been a sucker
            for the ol' fashioned romance, and I've read <i>way</i> too many romance mangas in my time (probably the latter).
            In any case, I wanted to express the idea of "unconditional love" through the story. The idea that,
            no matter what happens, someone will always be there by your side. Through the thick and thin, just... waiting.
            <br>
            <br>
            It's both romantic and sad at the same time, since unconditional love means that you don't actually know if those
            feelings will be reciprocated in any way. One-sided love often hurts, and that's something I wanted to show. But
            at the same time, I didn't want it to end that way since it would be too sad. That, and something else. One-sided
            love might hurt at times, but the moment that becomes reciprocated the joy of that far outweighs the pains from the past.
            <br>

            <i>Ahem</i>, that's enough of that. More about the site. It's a mixture of horizontal scrolling (I more or less got the
            hang of this after the last assignment), fading in, and audio. We had a few hiccups in the process, but in the end we got
            it done. Ed Sheeran's <i>Photograph</i> was a great match for the story.
            If you want to read more about what went on behind the scenes, look <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1J4UQcu_qTz_nBc06o8E2Jo-NYhnYVczPQcQ4WqdBqaM/edit?usp=sharing">here</a>.

            <br>
            If you want to play around with the site, keep scrolling down.
