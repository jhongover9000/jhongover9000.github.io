        <h2>videos and interactivity.</h2>
        <p style="font-size: 3vh;">
            How do you make a video, interactive? This was something that our group spent a lot of time thinking about,
            trying to come up with different ideas on video interactivity. To be honest, <i>Cyberpunk 2077</i> had quite
            a lot to do with the form of interactivity in this project–– which ended up being very similar to <i>Bandersnatch</i>.
            I still need to watch it, but I hear that it doesn't end very well (spoilers?).
            <br>
            <br>
            In any case, the project was split into two main parts: the code and the film. The code was built around JavaScript,
            and I decided it would be a great idea to make the code as dynamic as possible, using object-oriented programming
            to make it as not-hardcoded as possible. It worked, thankfully, and the integration with the film also went great.
            <br>
            <br>
            We went into this project without a solid idea of what we were making, just a general idea in the direction we were going.
            It was ambitious, for sure, and we had to reduce some filming, editing, and coding in some places in order to meet the 
            time deadline. Despite all of that, we were able to put together a finished piece that we were satisfied with.
