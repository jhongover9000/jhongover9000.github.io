### Introduction
Mind Over Matter, or MM for short, is a small device placed in the brain, in the substantia nigra and the ventral tegmental area. These two areas play a large role in the learning of new motor skills and reward/motivation, respectively, and are activated when dopamine is released in those regions. MM regulates the amount of dopamine released in the brain at a given time, depending on various factors. However, the main selling point of Mind Over Matter is its ability to help users build new, good habits while breaking bad ones.

Process
So, first we had two main ideas, but both were related to building skills by manipulating the brain. One was this product, the other was a full-dive virtual reality system where one could learn skills and consolidate knowledge. In the end we went with Mind Over Matter because it seemed a bit closer to our time (at the same time somewhat distant) but also because it could be sorta controversial(?) depending on how it’s used.


### How It Works
If a desirable action, hence the habit one wishes to build, is performed or is in the process of being performed, the regulated amount of dopamine is released in order to “reward” the user. On the other hand, if an undesired action, the bad habit that the user wishes to break, is performed or is being performed, the device prevents the usual rush of dopamine from being released, thus reducing the motivation and in turn the rewarding sense of pleasure one might get from the action.
To further understand how this process works, we have to first understand how dopamine is connected to motivation and good behaviors. Dopamine is one of the “feel good” chemicals in our brain. In addition to affecting our mood and how happy we feel, dopamine also affects movement, memory, and focus. Healthy levels of dopamine drive us to seek and repeat pleasurable activities, while low levels can have an adverse physical and psychological impact. 
When the brain has a healthy level of dopamine, motivation and productivity increase. That concept specifically is what we plan to tap into with our project. MM navigates that aspect of how the brain functions in hopes of creating a motivated, goal-oriented person that is able to create the habits they’ve always wanted to have. 
The device is also equipped with the ability to monitor the release of dopamine in your brain. Low dopamine levels, also called “dopamine deficiency,” can make us feel fatigued and restless. Instead of feeling full of life, it can leave us feeling unmotivated, depressed, and anxious. This is why the monitoring of dopamine levels is absolutely imperative. This is also to make sure that the MM is not misused and that actions selected by a user are not already habits (i.e., if a person wants to have a greater ‘high’ for a certain action) or rewarding.


### The Artificial Intelligence Machine Learning
The machine learning involved with Mind Over Matter exists in a few forms, depending on how the device is installed.
The first case is if the user already has a NeuraLink (who doesn’t during this time?). This is the simplest case, with less of a load on the device, as if interfaced with the NeuraLink certain actions will be recognizable after a given period of time. This would allow MM to then take these movements and process them into an action, and from action to whether it is desirable or not. It would then either release additional dopamine or suppress the overflow of it; thus the user would feel ‘motivated’ to build a good habit and break a bad one.
At this point in time, NeuraLink can predict (or recognize) a movement before it is made and, if extended even further, can even predict one’s thoughts. This would mean that MM would not only be able to help you build good physical habits, but also mental ones–– by letting you feel pleasure in thinking about ‘good’ things.
An additional plus of using the NeuraLink would be that the biological feedback would be a bit more detailed and thus the MM device (which is equipped with basic feedback detection, but isn’t as intricate as NeuraLink, which maps out the entire brain) would have an easier time adjusting doses and adapting to the user’s body.
The second case is if the user does not have a NeuraLink (but everyone does!). In this case, the device’s system can be paired with lenses. Here, the machine learning involved would be computer vision and recognizing actions of the user, processing these and regulating the amount of dopamine in response.
Both methods require that the user take a buffer time of a week in order for the MM to analyze and recognize your actions, as the learning model adapts to your quirks or preferences. During this period, users will be able to select the actions (via phone/device interface) that they want to make habits and the bad habits they want to break. Users will be able to continuously add or remove actions/habits once the device has been initialized and personalized, as the MM will continue to adapt to the subtle changes in the user.

### Theorizing the Business
Cost of initial surgery: $19,999
→ Costs of surgery are reduced due to the use of AI in operations with high precision and low failure rates.
Discounts: Student Discount ($18,999), Family Discount ($1,000 x # of family members already using MM) Only a maximum of one discount can apply. Discounts cannot be used together.
Insurance/After Service Packages: For a small one-time fee upon purchase of the initial installation, you can have up to 40 years of service with replacements in the case of device failure (only one half-cost replacement every 10 years).
The FutureSafe Package: $7,999 for 25 years of free service and discounted replacement
The FutureSure Package: $10,999 for 40 years of free service and discounted replacement

### Implications
There are a number of implications that such a device could bring. These can be largely split into three categories: self-improvement, prescription, and rehabilitation. Of course, even within these areas things can be beneficial or detrimental. And since we don’t have expertise in these areas, we can’t say for certain that they will have impacts in these areas, either.
The first category of self-improvement is rather straightforward: using Mind Over Matter for building new habits. The second category of prescription could be where the device can have a prescriptive effect. The third category of rehabilitation could be where the device is used to help people overcome addiction or help them in rehab. Once again, we aren’t experts so we won’t try to give examples that might not work.
These implications may not be that large, but they will have an influence on how decisions are made. Some issues might occur when such devices are believed to be ‘absolute’ solutions, leading to riskier decisions that may cause irreversible harm.
There will obviously be people who attempt to mess around with the AI in the device or exploit the dopamine-releasing features of the device. Because of this, not only security but also the ‘intelligence’ of the machine learning model in the device will be important.

### Conclusion
So that’s about it for Mind Over Matter. It’s a device meant to help you boost your productivity, but can also help in different areas, too. It uses machine learning to recognize your habits, your actions, and adapt to your quirks, too.
Is it worth the trouble to get the device installed in your brain? Well, if the future we see is coming, it’d be expensive, but worth it in the long run. But as with everything, the choice is ultimately up to you.
