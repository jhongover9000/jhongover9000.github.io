        <h3>You are a Navigator.</h3>
        <p>Trained to be the best of the best, you assist Jumpers in their Journeys. 
            <br>
            <br>
            If Jumpers are the ones who have the ability to teleport between different locations, 
            you, as a Navigator, provide the coordinates of those locations.
            <br>
            Without a Navigator, Jumpers are unable to teleport further than what they can see. When they 
            jump too many times, their ability locks and they cannot jump for a full 24 hours. During this time,
            they often become subject to extremely bad luck.
            <br>
            <br>
            As one of the top graduates of your class, 
            youâ€™ve been assigned to one of the best Jumpers in the Organization. He's a bit rough around the 
            edges, but we can guarantee his ability.
            <br>
            <br>
            It <i>did</i> take a lot of persuading to assign you to him, though...
            <br>
            <br>
            In any case, it'll be the same as training. One mistake in your calculations can
            send a Jumper in a completely different direction, so be careful. If we can give you 
            some advice about your new partner... try not to mess up.
            <br>
            <br>
            Good luck, Navigator. You'll need it.
        </p>
